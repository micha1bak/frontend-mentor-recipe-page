## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my skills in creating responsive web layouts using **Flexbox** and **media queries**. Flexbox allowed me to efficiently align and distribute elements, making the design more adaptable to different screen sizes. 

````css
.recipe {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 700px;
  background-color: white;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
````

I also used media queries to fine-tune the layout for various devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

````css
@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .recipe {
    width: 90%;
    margin: 20px;
    border-radius: 20px;
  }
  img {
    border-radius: 20px 20px 0 0;
  }
}
````

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to deepen my understanding of **media queries** to create even more refined and adaptive layouts for different screen sizes. I also plan to explore **CSS transitions and animations** to enhance user experience with smooth and engaging visual effects. Additionally, I aim to learn **CSS frameworks** like Tailwind CSS to speed up development and maintain clean, scalable styles. By focusing on these areas, I hope to build more dynamic and visually appealing web projects. ðŸš€
